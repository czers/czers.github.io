## About me

Hi! My name is Michał Czerski. I live in Sopot and work in Gdańsk, both of
which are parts of [Tricity area][tricity] in Poland. By day, I am
[an enterprise C# web developer][ihs-gdansk] with keen interest in security
& DevOps. By night, I am ~~Batman~~. Oops, almost gave it away.

My favorite pastime activites include cooking, reading, taking photos and
protecting my sanity while balancing privacy and usability in modern web.
