Recipe (for 18g of coffee and 300g of water):

1. Pour 30g of water for pre-infusion/blooming
2. Wait 30s
3. Pour 70g of water in short and intense pour (try to stir all of the coffee grounds with this pour)
4. Wait another 30s (till 1 minute mark)
5. Pour last 200g of water over 50s-1m15s in a slow and consistent fashion, centered in the middle of the cone (no circling motion)

I've used 95°C hot water here — I got no tips on this so I will experiment a little bit and see what works well.

I've used this [pour-over][pour-over] recipe for [CRS CoffeeRoasters'][crs-coffee-roasters] Ethiopia Konga Sedie, which has lots of citrus and black tea flavors, and I'm really satisfied with the result.
